	<p>Roses are perennial flowering plants known for their beautiful,
		fragrant blooms and thorny stems. They belong to the family 
		Rosaceae, which also includes other popular plants like apples,
		cherries, and strawberries.</p>

	<p>A typical rose flower has multiple petals arranged in a whorl around
		a central core. The number of petals can vary significantly depending
		on the species and cultivar, ranging from a simple five-petaled flower
		to complex, multi-layered blooms with dozens of petals.</p>
